## Welcome to Paest. ##

Paest is a pastebin made by hackers, for hackers.

After years of using other pastebins and making our own for collaboration...
we finally rage-built something suitable to our workflows.

CLI friendly, simple API, and a minimal web interface that does all the work
for you.

Lets break it down...

### Web Interface ###
 
 * Auto redirects you to a unique url when visiting: http://pae.st
 * Pick your own url: http://pae.st/MyAwesomePathNameHere
 * Enable linting/highlighting via file extension: http://pae.st/fZ.py
 * Saves as you type, so dont worry about a submit/save button
 * Local Storage backup as you type so you dont lose things if you go offline
 * Paests automatically expire after 1 week of inactivity
 * You can continue to edit paests you create, others auto-fork. ( Edit me! )
 * Open source: <http://github.com/paest/paest-web>
